### Stack

## About
implemented stack and queue data structure since the go standard library doesn't include one. This is so, if the need arises, I have a ready made package that implements and handles the fine grained details of these data structures

## How to install
if you would like to install this package feel free to add it to your $GOPATH, its open source after all :wink:
